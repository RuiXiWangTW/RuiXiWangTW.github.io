I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at MIT EECS and Mathematics. Originally from Taipei, Taiwan, I transfered from National Taiwan University(where I started my undergrad studies) to MIT and moved to the US after my freshman year. I'm working with Professor [Connor Coley](https://coley.mit.edu/) and [RunZhong Wang](https://runzhong.wang/) on the development of Comninatorial and Machine Learning Mass Spectrum Prediction Model. Previously, I worked with Professor [Rafael Gomez Bombarelli](https://gomezbombarelli.mit.edu/) and [Kevin Greenman](https://www.kevinpgreenman.com/) on benchmarking the performance of NIR absorption prediction models. My current research interests are in AI4Science. Specifically, I'm interested in developing machine learning methods with applications in chemistry, drug discovery, and healthcare industry.
