I recently graduated from MIT with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. Originally from Taipei, Taiwan, I transferred from National Taiwan University to MIT and moved to the United States after my freshman year. I am currently working with Professor [Connor Coley](https://coley.mit.edu/)
and [Runzhong Wang](https://runzhong.wang/) on developing combinatorial and machine learning–based mass spectrum prediction models. Previously, I worked with professor [Ramesh Raskar](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/camera-culture/overview/) and Abhishek Singh on decentralized AI for healthcare, and with Professor [Rafael Gomez Bombarelli](https://gomezbombarelli.mit.edu/) and 
[Kevin Greenman](https://www.kevinpgreenman.com/) on benchmarking the performance of NIR absorption prediction models. My current research 
interests are in AI4Science. My current research interests lie in AI for Science, particularly in developing machine learning methods with applications in chemistry, drug discovery, and healthcare.
