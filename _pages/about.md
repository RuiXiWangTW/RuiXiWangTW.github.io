I recently graduated from MIT with a BS degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. Originally from Taipei, Taiwan, I transfered from National Taiwan 
University to MIT and moved to the US after my freshman year. I'm working with Professor [Connor Coley](https://coley.mit.edu/)
and [Runzhong Wang](https://runzhong.wang/) on the development of Combinatorial and Machine Learning Mass Spectrum Prediction Model.  Previously, I have worked with professor [Ramesh Raskar](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/camera-culture/overview/) and Abhishek Singh on the development of
decentralized AI for healthcare and Professor [Rafael Gomez Bombarelli](https://gomezbombarelli.mit.edu/) and 
[Kevin Greenman](https://www.kevinpgreenman.com/) on benchmarking the performance of NIR absorption prediction models. My current research 
interests are in AI4Science. Specifically, I'm interested in developing machine learning methods with applications in chemistry, drug 
discovery, and healthcare industry.
